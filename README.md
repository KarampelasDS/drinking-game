# Bottom's Up! - Web-Based Drinking Game

Welcome to **Bottom's Up!**, a fun and interactive drinking game built with **React** and **Next.js**. It includes multiple exciting modes for you and your friends to enjoy during social gatherings. Whether you're into group votes, truth or dare, or random challenges, this game has something for everyone!

## Features

- **Guilty as Charged**: Group votes on who fits a description best. The voted player drinks.
- **Truth or Drink**: Choose between truth or dare. If you refuse, you drink!
